Idea: Beer
- Patterns to cast shit (up, up, down, down etc.)
- Mana -> regeneration over time
- monster power-down with e.g. meteor shower
- Different powers -> Water, Air, fire blabla
- Monster powers -> 3 levels
- Cast spells from a higher position -> cast with keyboard, place with mouse
- Monsters gain levels if you miss stuff
- Spells do damage i.e. when playing on hard it needs 2 shots
- Upgrade powers -> skill tree


Multiplayer:
- shift patterns
- powerups
